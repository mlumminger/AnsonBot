[23:22:40]: #general | Max: <@!351574671109521410> yo vinh did you see that essay hudson sent
[23:23:28]: #general | Max: if repl becomes a problem I can always host on a raspberry pi or something
[23:23:34]: #general | Max: or just on one of our computers
[23:27:05]: #general | RandomGuy4422: yeah you host it then
[23:27:22]: #general | RandomGuy4422: we just code it and then you can host by copy and pasting it into youor own file
[23:28:26]: #general | Max: here join voice im too lazy to type
[23:28:33]: #general | RandomGuy4422: its already a problem so instead you can host it on your own
[23:28:48]: #general | RandomGuy4422: IM TOO LAZY TO TLAK
[23:28:51]: #general | Max: cringe
[23:28:52]: #general | Max: ok
[23:29:12]: #general | Max: so keeping it up 24/7 isnt an issue
[23:29:31]: #general | RandomGuy4422: yeah its if someone is being a baddie
[23:29:34]: #general | RandomGuy4422: and gets banned
[23:29:42]: #general | RandomGuy4422: wait no if the bot gets banned
[23:29:44]: #general | Max: if the bot gets ip banned, we can switch to hosting on computer
[23:29:49]: #general | Max: i have node.js installed
[23:30:01]: #general | Max: and I can move to a pi but that would take a bit
[23:30:05]: #general | RandomGuy4422: why not switch now?
[23:30:17]: #general | RandomGuy4422: because "if someone is running a user bot on their service and gets banned, everyone on that IP will be banned. Including you."
[23:30:19]: #general | RandomGuy4422: so uh
[23:30:22]: #general | RandomGuy4422: switch now
[23:30:23]: #general | RandomGuy4422: STFU
[23:30:25]: #general | RandomGuy4422: ANSON BOT
[23:30:26]: #general | Max: LMAO
[23:30:33]: #general | Max: cause its annoying to setup and a pain to keep running
[23:30:47]: #general | RandomGuy4422: IF THE BOTS GETS BANNED WE DO TOO
[23:30:50]: #general | Max: i gotta find a nice out of the way spot connected to ethernet and then it gets hot sometimes and shit id rather not
[23:30:51]: #general | RandomGuy4422: SO WE HAVE TO SWITCH LOL
[23:30:51]: #general | Max: what?
[23:31:01]: #general | RandomGuy4422: "everyone on that IP will be banned. Including you."
[23:31:20]: #general | Max: yeah the bot will get banned if someone else using the same ip with repl gets their bot ip banned
[23:31:28]: #general | Max: WE wont get banned
[23:31:44]: #general | Max: its because repl hosts from the same few ips so a discord ip ban could effect our bot
[23:32:11]: #general | RandomGuy4422: welp
[23:32:15]: #general | RandomGuy4422: i left hudson on read
[23:32:18]: #general | Max: lol
[23:32:21]: #general | RandomGuy4422: and i dont feel like responding
[23:32:24]: #general | RandomGuy4422: say thanbks
[23:32:26]: #general | RandomGuy4422: to him
[23:32:26]: #general | RandomGuy4422: for me
[23:32:28]: #general | RandomGuy4422: please
[23:32:29]: #general | Max: yea me neither though
[23:32:45]: #general | Max: also i have no clue what an epherameal file system is or whatever and why that would be an issue
[23:32:56]: #general | RandomGuy4422: search it up duh
[23:33:08]: #general | Max: i did and the results didnt really tell me anything or mention anything that bad
[23:33:24]: #general | Max: he says "This means any file you saved via your bot will be overwritten when you next launch." but like we are saving to files so i dont know what hes talking about
[23:33:58]: #general | RandomGuy4422: psh asak him
[23:33:58]: #general | RandomGuy4422: dm
[23:37:44]: #general | Max: lmaooo
[23:37:53]: #general | Max: I cant dm him
[23:37:53]: #general | Max: so
[23:38:00]: #general | RandomGuy4422: whatt
[23:38:02]: #general | RandomGuy4422: wdym
[23:38:10]: #general | Max: well I was gonna send him this
[23:38:10]: #general | Max: vinh and I read what you sent and I'm not super concerned about most of the points, and I can always switch to hosting on a raspberry pi if issues come up. The only thing i was confused about was the ephemeral file system point, could you explain in a lil more detail what you mean by that and why that could be an issue?
[23:38:11]: #general | RandomGuy4422: have the bot dm him
[23:38:12]: #general | RandomGuy4422: forehead
[23:38:18]: #general | Max: but
[23:38:29]: #general | RandomGuy4422: LOL
[23:38:38]: #general | Max: he put everything on like maximum privacy or whatever so I cant dm him without being friends
[23:38:40]: #general | RandomGuy4422: <#846222971668004877> THEN
[23:38:54]: #general | Max: oh and guess what?
[23:39:00]: #general | Max: HE DOESNT ACCEPT FRIEND REQUESTS
[23:39:02]: #general | RandomGuy4422: LMAOOOOOO
[23:39:07]: #general | Max: LIKE WHAT??
[23:39:15]: #general | Max: IS HE A CELEBRITY WITH TOO MANY HOES TRYNA TALK TO HIM
[23:39:54]: #general | RandomGuy4422: TALK
[23:39:57]: #general | RandomGuy4422: IN GENERAL I GUESS
[23:43:48]: #general | Max: ok yeah i dm'd him
[23:49:09]: #general | Max: ok well apparently from what hes seen there could be problems with files being pulled from git not saving properly or something?
[23:49:26]: #general | Max: so far I havent seen any issue with file saving but also we havent used a ton of git
[23:51:26]: #general | Max: anyway i think we should be good besides performance inevitably getting worse as we add more complicated stuff
[00:01:50]: #general | RandomGuy4422: well its literally only on one server
[00:02:06]: #general | RandomGuy4422: performance would be an issue if we had it on multiple servers
[00:02:17]: #general | RandomGuy4422: but its only on one and we have like 10 people using it only
[07:51:27]: #general | Max: also i think i fixed the reaction bug try getting a reaction with a command
